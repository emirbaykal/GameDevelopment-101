## Object Oriented Programming Principles
  * [Encapsulation](Assets/GameDevelopment-101/OOP_Principles/Encapsulation)
    * [Inheritance](Assets/GameDevelopment-101/OOP_Principles/Inheritance)
    * [Polymorphism](Assets/GameDevelopment-101/OOP_Principles/Polymorphism)
    * Abstraction
      *  [Should I use abstraction? Or virtual?](Assets/GameDevelopment-101/OOP_Principles/Abstraction/Abstract&Virtual)
      *  [Interface vs Abstract](Assets/GameDevelopment-101/OOP_Principles/Abstraction/Interface&Abstract)
## SOLID Principles
### [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](Assets/GameDevelopment-101/SOLID_Principles/SRP)

In short, each class should perform a single task. In the example, I proceeded with a Character. I emphasized that Input, Movement, and updates should be in separate classes, not in a single controller.
      
  * The most important reasons for using this method are:
    - Easy readability
    - Ease of updating the code.
    - Reduced dependency in teamwork.
    - Easy debugging
